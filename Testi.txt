Safari is a website that allows you to
choose from various paths leading to the discovery of how animals have been represented and
interpreted by designers and illustrators from the 1940s to the early 2000s.</p>

The project is born with the aim of exploring and highlighting the role of
animals within graphic design. In fact,our relationship with animals throughout history has
significantly enriched ourartistic, narrative, and cultural heritage.</p>

The projectwas created by a group of Communication Design students from
Politecnico di Milano, interested in bringing out the role of animals through a narrative guided
by data visualization. A total of 150 works were extracted and cataloged from the Aiap archive,
respecting various criteria including habitat (hence thename "safari"), technique (illustration,
photography, mixed media),and representative style (realistic, pictographic, and surreal). These
parameters will allow you to create your personalized Photographic Safari.</p>

Step into the fascinating world where design merges with the animal world, exploring the
different perspectives and styles that have shaped the representation of our collective
imagination.</p>
