Explore the Photo<i>graphic</i> Safari in this website; you will be able to choose 
between a selection of routes, walking you to the discovery of how animals have been represented and
interpreted by designers and illustrators through time, from the 1940s to the early 2000s.</p>

The project was born with the goal of investigating and highlighting the role of animals within 
graphic design. In fact, our relationship with animals throughout history has significantly 
enriched and often directly guided the artistic, narrative and cultural production in our heritage.</p>

This project has been designed by a group of Communication Design students from the 
Polytechnic University of Milan, interested in flashing out the implications of animal representations 
through an experience led by data visualization. A total of 150 works were selected from the Aiap (Associazione italiana design della comunicazione visiva) 
archive and catalogued, following various criteria including habitat (hence the idea of a "safari"), technique 
(illustration, photography, mixed media), and type of interpretation (realistic, pictographic, and surreal). 
These parameters are the way your personalized Photo<i>graphic</i> Safaris have been shaped.</p>

Step into a fascinating world where design merges with the animal realm, exploring the 
different perspectives and styles that have shaped the various representations in our 
collective imagination.</p>
